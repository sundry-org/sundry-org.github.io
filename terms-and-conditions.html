		<p><span>Informal Negotiations</span></p>
		<p><span>To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or</span></p>
		<p><span>claim related to these Legal Terms (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the</span></p>
		<p><span>"Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a "Party" and</span></p>

		<p><span>Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at</span></p>
		<p><span>least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations</span></p>
		<p><span>commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.</span></p>
		<p> </p>
		<p><span>Binding Arbitration</span></p>
		<p><span>Any dispute arising from the relationships between the Parties to these</span></p>
		<p><span>Legal Terms shall be determined by one arbitrator who will be chosen in</span></p>
		<p><span>accordance with the Arbitration and Internal Rules of the European Court of</span></p>
		<p><span>Arbitration being part of the European Centre of Arbitration having its seat</span></p>
		<p><span>in Strasbourg, and which are in force at the time the application for</span></p>
		<p><span>arbitration is filed, and of which adoption of this clause constitutes</span></p>
		<p><span>acceptance. The seat of arbitration shall be Athens, Greece, Greece. The</span></p>
		<p><span>language of the proceedings shall be Greek. Applicable rules of substantive</span></p>
		<p><span>law shall be the law of Greece.</span></p>
		<p> </p>
		<p><span>Restrictions</span></p>
		<p><span>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute</span></p>
		<p><span>between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no</span></p>
		<p><span>arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or</span></p>
		<p><span>authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize</span></p>
		<p><span>class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any</span></p>
		<p><span>Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of</span></p>
		<p><span>the general public or any other persons.</span></p>
		<p> </p>
		<p><span>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</span></p>
		<p><span>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above</span></p>
		<p><span>provisions concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any</span></p>
		<p><span>Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of</span></p>
		<p><span>the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or</span></p>
		<p><span>arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized</span></p>
		<p><span>use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be</span></p>
		<p><span>illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any</span></p>
		<p><span>Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or</span></p>
		<p><span>unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent</span></p>
		<p><span>jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties</span></p>
